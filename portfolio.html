<p style="font-size:25px;color:white;">~ LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY ~ </p><br>
<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Landscape photography is the art of capturing pictures of nature and the outdoors in a way that brings your viewer into the scene. From grand landscapes to intimate details,
 the best photos demonstrate the photographer’s own connection to nature and capture the essence of the world around them. Below, you’ll find all the landscape photography articles we have written over the past decade,
 including our highly approachable tutorials and techniques. If you want to learn everything about taking beautiful landscape pictures, this is the place to start.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size:25px;color:white;">~ ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY ~</p><br>
<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;"> Astrophotography is a specialised photographic discipline concerned with taking shots of objects in the night sky.It stretches from capturing a moon shot or star-speckled 
vista in the backyard right through to multiple long exposures of deep sky objects.While it even includes images captured over a computer link to a remote telescope in a far-off observatory, for most photographers, 
it’s about using their own camera gear to shoot the sky at night.The most accessible form of astrophotography requires nothing more than a DSLR or mirrorless camera, a reasonably fast lens, and a tripod.
If your area suffers from light pollution – where street and city lighting spills upwards and reflects off airborne dust and water droplets to create a hazy glow of unwanted light – then it’s worth travelling to 
a certified ‘dark sky area’ or at least out into the rural countryside.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Aerial photography, technique of photographing the Earth’s surface or features of its atmosphere or hydrosphere with cameras mounted on aircraft, rockets, or Earth-orbiting 
satellites and other spacecraft.For the mapping of terrestrial features, aerial photographs usually are taken in overlapping series from an aircraft following a systematic flight pattern at a fixed altitude. 
Each photograph depicts an area that includes several control points,the locations of which are determined by ground-surveying techniques. A technique known as photogrammetry (q.v.), which involves the 
simultaneous projection of the overlapping views, makes possible the preparation of contour maps or three-dimensional models of the terrestrial surface that has been photographed. Valuable data on 
topography, geology, hydrology, soil and vegetation, meteorology, ocean currents, and fish resources have become accessible with the use of satellite technology and expert interpretation.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size:25px;color:white;">~ AESTHETIC PHOTOGRAPHY ~</p><br>
<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Aesthetic photography is a photographic practice of capturing visual beauty within an image. Just as the term “beauty” can be subjective, “aesthetic” can be distinguished 
as something that is immediately visually pleasing to a viewer.Aesthetic photos aim to utilize visual characteristics such as color, composition, lighting, and subject matter to create a visually pleasing photo
graph.Aesthetics, on the other hand, goes a little further than technical aspects. Aesthetics in photography refers to patterns in a photographer's use of visual elements to create beautiful images. 
These elements can be frame compositions, subjects, color schemes and lighting techniques.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size:25px;color:white;">~ COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY ~</p>">
<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Commercial photography is a genre that encompasses any photos used for a business or publication. “It’s photography that helps sell things,” says photographer Andrew Bennett. 
“When I do commercial photography, it’s because a company has a product or service to sell and needs content to help sell it.” From websites to billboards to social media campaigns, there’s almost no limit to the
 potential commercial uses for photos.Food photography, fashion photography, architecture photography, headshots, and portrait photography are just some of the types of photos that fall under the commercial umbrella. 
You can work in a studio to produce a unique, stylized photography shoot, or a company may simply license a photo you took independently.</p><br><br><br>
